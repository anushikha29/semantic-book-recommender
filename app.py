Welcome to **Semantic Book Recommender**, an intelligent tool designed to help you discover books based on **meaning, mood, and themes** and built straight from the heart of an avid reader 💛

### 🚀 Why This Project?
Ever since I can remember, books have been more than just stories — they’ve been a source of comfort, adventure, and a way of understanding life.  
As a reader myself, I’ve often wished for recommendations that *understood* what I was truly in the mood for — whether something emotionally rich, suspenseful, or full of joy.
This project was my way of combining that love for literature with my passion for technology.  
It uses advanced **natural language processing**, **semantic search**, **emotion detection**, and **zero-shot classification** to suggest books not just based on genre — but based on **feeling** ✨.
Traditional book recommendation engines often overlook your current emotions or the deeper themes you wish to explore. This tool uses **semantic embeddings, vector databases, and NLP** to find books that align with your current mindset, making your reading journey more personal and meaningful.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python
- LangChain
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Chroma (Vector DB)
- Gradio(Initial) and Streamlit(current)
- [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata)
